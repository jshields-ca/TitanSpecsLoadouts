# Titan Panel [Specs & Loadouts]

Quickly view and swap your talent loadouts from Titan Panel.

Titan Panel [Specs & Loadouts] shows your **current specialization** and **active loadout** on the Titan bar, and adds a right-click menu that groups your saved loadouts under each spec.

## Why this addon?

If you frequently swap between raid, Mythic+, solo, or utility setups, this plugin removes a lot of clicks:

- See your current spec/loadout at a glance
- Open Titan right-click menu
- Pick the exact saved loadout you want
- If needed, the addon switches spec first, then applies that loadout

## Features

- Titan bar text: **Spec + Active Loadout**
- Right-click menu grouped by all class specializations
- Saved loadouts listed per specialization
- Cross-spec loadout pick support (auto-switch + apply)
- Lightweight and focused (single-purpose Titan plugin)

## Requirements

- **World of Warcraft Retail**
- **Titan Panel** (required dependency)

## Installation

1. Download and extract.
2. Place `TitanSpecsLoadouts` in:
   - `_retail_/Interface/AddOns/`
3. Start game and enable **Titan Panel [Specs & Loadouts]**.

## Usage

- Add the plugin to Titan Panel if needed.
- Check current spec/loadout on the panel.
- Right-click plugin -> specialization -> saved loadout.

## Notes

- In combat, WoW may block spec/talent changes; addon relies on Blizzard's native restrictions and messages.
- Uses modern retail talent loadout APIs.

## Feedback

Bug reports and suggestions are welcome. Include your class/spec and a short reproduction path when reporting issues.
